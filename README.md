# procedural animated fish.

it's just a bunch of procedurally animated fish wondering around the screen.

the algorithm is just an inverse kinematic arm that isn't locked to any point and each segment has circles of different radiuses.
the algorithm gets vertexes from each segments and creates the shape of the fish.
